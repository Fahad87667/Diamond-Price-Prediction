# Diamond Price Prediction with Linear Regression

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting diamond prices using a linear regression model. The goal is to understand and model the relationship between various features of diamonds and their prices, enabling accurate price predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about various diamonds, including carat weight, cut, color, clarity, and price. The dataset was sourced from kaggle [gemstone.csv].

## Features

The dataset used for this project contains the following features:

- **Carat Weight:** The weight of the diamond in carats.
- **Depth:** The depth of the diamond in percentage.
- **Table:** The width of the top of the diamond relative to its widest point in percentage.
- **Cut:** The quality of the diamond's cut (e.g., Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal).
- **Color:** The color grade of the diamond (ranging from D to Z, with D being colorless and Z having noticeable color).
- **Clarity:** The clarity grade of the diamond (e.g., I1, SI1, SI2, VS1, VS2, VVS1, VVS2, IF).

## Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/diamond-price-prediction.git
cd diamond-price-prediction
```

2. Install Dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the `app.py` script to start the diamond price prediction application.

```bash
python app.py
```

## Evaluation

The following metrics were used for evaluating the model's performance:

- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** This metric measures the average magnitude of the errors between predicted and actual values, giving more weight to larger errors.

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** It calculates the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values, providing a measure of the variance in the errors.

- **R-squared (R2):** This metric indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (diamond prices) that is predictable from the independent variables (features). It ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating a better fit.

## Future Work

While the current model performs well, there is always room for improvement. Future work may include exploring additional features, experimenting with different algorithms, or fine-tuning hyperparameters to further enhance the model's predictive capabilities.
